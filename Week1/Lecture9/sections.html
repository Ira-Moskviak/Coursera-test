			How to make your own chocolate
		</a>
		<h4>What is chocolate?</h4>
		<p>	
			Chocolate is produced from the seed of the cacao tree.<br />
			Unfortunately for many home gardeners eager to have their own stash of chocolate, trees grow only in tropical regions: Central America, the Caribbean, Indonesia, and Africa.
		</p>
		<h4>Cacao production</h4>
		<p>
			Cacao production is labor-intensive. Trees require hand harvesting and machetes, as the pods can reach a size comparable to butternut squash and hold between 30 and 50 beans.<br />
			Cacao trees grown in the wild with shade can maintain production for nearly 100 years. Take that, biennials.
		</p>
		<h4>Cacao processing</h4>
		<p>
			The beans, about the size of almonds, are allowed to ferment for 3 to 7 days and then dried. This fermentation is essential — the raw seeds are very bitter. <br />
			After fermentation beans must be sorted, cleaned, and weighed before roasting.
			After roasting, the beans enter a machine that cracks the seed coats and blows them away, leaving behind cacao nibs, which are 47% cocoa solids and 53% cocoa butter.
			Cocoa butter (from cacao) is the main source of fat in chocolate. The cocoa solids are ground into cocoa powder, the same stuff that flavors your chocolate protein powder.
			Cacao nibs left after bean cracking can be milled into a “nut butter”-like paste, called chocolate liquor (alcohol free), which can then be pressed.
			The chocolate liquor on its own is dry and gritty. It can be combined with other ingredients like sugar, vanilla, and lecithin to make a more palatable product, and/or be broken down on machinery and kneaded for days to improve the texture. Careful heating and cooling will create a stable structure.

		<h4>Types of chocolate you’ll find</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><h5>Unsweetened chocolate</h5></li>
				Made from 100% cocoa liquor and bitter unless mixed with other ingredients. ( I learned this when I took a bite of my mom’s unsweetened baking chocolate at the age of 7.)
			<li><h5>Bittersweet, semisweet, or dark chocolate</h5></li>
				Dark chocolate can contain no milk powder and must have a minimum of 35% cocoa solids. Bittersweet and semisweet are similar and differ based on the percentage of sugar.
			<li><h5>Milk chocolate</h5></li>
				At least 10% chocolate liquor and 12% milk solids. Also has more sugar than dark or semisweet.
			<li><h5>White chocolate</h5></li>
				Well, it’s not really chocolate, as it’s made from cocoa butter, sugar, and flavorings.
		</ul>
		<h4>Cocoa powder</h4>
		<p>
			A crushed and ground solid left after cocoa butter is removed from chocolate liquor. Cocoa powder is typically unsweetened.
			There are two main varieties, regular and Dutch process. Dutch is alkalized to neutralize the acid. If you cook with baking powder, use Dutch. If you cook with baking soda, use regular.

		<h3>The ingredients</h3>
		Here are the ingredients (and amounts) you need on hand to make your own raw chocolate.<br />
		<ul>
		 	<li>1/2 cup cocoa butter</li>
			<li>1/2 cup virgin coconut oil</li>
			<li>1/2 cup (raw)  organic cocoa powder</li>
			<li>1/4 – 1/2 cup agave syrup for sweetening</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(organic honey, stevia or raw cane sugar okay too; or you don’t have to use any sweetener at all)</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>Let’s get started</h3>
		Here are the steps for making your own, raw chocolate.
		<div>
			<h4>Step 1.</h4>
			Grate 1/2 cup of the cocoa butter. <br />
			(it will melt easier when it’s grated)<br />
			Measure also 1/2 cup of coconut oil.
			<h4>Step 2.</h4>
			Place cocoa butter and coconut oil in a water in a small, heat-safe cup or bowl.<br />
			Then place the cup or bowl in a shallow pan containing a small amount of warm (not boiling, but nearly) water.<br /> 
			Stir the oil and butter occasionally until it’s smooth.
			<h4>Step 3.</h4>
			Measure 1/2 cup cocoa powder.  If you’d like to add any other dry ingredients, measure them out now and stir them together with the cocoa powder.<br />
			Note: In this recipe, I used 1/4 cup lucuma powder and 1 tbsp. maca.<br />
			Natural vanilla or vanilla extract would work here also.
			<h4>Step 4.</h4>
			Pour the dry ingredients in the bowl with melted oil and butter. Stir continuously until smooth.
			<h4>Step 5.</h4>
			If you want to sweeten your chocolate, pour 4-6 tbsp agave nectar into the mix and stir.  If not, skip this step.
			<h4>Step 6.</h4>
			Have someone check the quality. Meaning… go ahead and check if the chocolate is sweet enough.<br />
			You can also add the rest of the additions at this point – like chili/cayenne, dried fruit, nuts etc.
			<h4>Step 7.</h4>
			Pour the melted chocolate on a pan / plate / ice cube tray. You can also throw some of the additions on top of the chocolate, it looks nice.<br />
			Place the chocolate for 30 minutes in the freezer or 60 minutes in the refrigerator.
			<h4>Step 8.</h4>
			Enjoy in moderation with good friends or family.<br />
			The more you share, the more you enjoy I can assure you your friends will be astonished by how delicious REAL chocolate is!

		<h3>Why Fair Trade chocolate is important:</h3>
		<p>
			Average world market price for cocoa in 2001: 49 cents/pound<br />
			Fair trade cocoa price: 80 cents/pound<br />
			Getting a fair price enables cocoa farmers to support their families.
		</p>
		<h4>Fair Trade certification means:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>fair work practices</li>
			<li>no child labor</li>
			<li>no forced labor</li>
			<li>association control via members</li>
			(in other words, small growers control their operations, not large corporations)
			<li>union activities</li>
			<li>good environmental practices</li>
			<li>sustainable crop management</li>
			<li>environmental safeguarding plans</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Thousands of acres of rainforest have been cleared for new cacao trees. Without environmental stewardship, the rainforest soil becomes nutrient-poor. New cacao trees can only be planted on the edges of forests where natural tree falls have occurred.
			When you indulge in chocolate, definitely look for Fair Trade Certified.
			Witch’s Broom is a fungus that can attack cacao trees.
			Humans were once sacrificed to guarantee a good cacao harvest.
			Refined chocolate is kept liquid by friction through a process called “conching,” which helps develop a smooth, creamy texture.

		<h3>Summary and recommendations</h3>
		Antioxidant-rich cocoa products might improve health.<br />
		This is especially true if you substitute a few small squares of dark chocolate for high-fat dairy products, processed snack foods or cookies in your usual diet.
		But hold on a second before you rip open that Snickers bar: We’re talking about cocoa here, not milk chocolate. The difference is monumental.
		Milk chocolate typically contains sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla as the base ingredients. And something like Snickers contains much more, including lactose, soy lecithin, artificial flavor, corn syrup, milk fat, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, salt, egg whites, and other food additives.
		This means that you’re getting very little real cocoa per bite!<br />
		Milk chocolate is standard junk food. It’s not nutritious nor healthy.<br />
		Real chocolate — the high percentage cocoa stuff — is another story.<br />
		<a name="aaa">Real chocolate is a very simple product. It contains cocoa. And it contains cocoa butter. That’s it.</a>
