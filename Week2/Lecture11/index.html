		<h1>Anatomy of a CSS Rule</h1>
		<h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
		<p>			
        	A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block.The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.<br />
